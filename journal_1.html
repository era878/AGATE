                <p class="blog-post-meta">1854 by Charles Layton</p>

                <p> Today I was assigned to the new lighthouse recently constructed in the Monterey Bay, this lighthouse
                    was one of the original seven that were ordered to be built in California by the 1852 Congress. I
                    enthralled when I learned that I would be $1,000. This
                    morning I met with the coastguard personnel for a quick run down of the duties and expectations of
                    the job but they cautioned me that this was one of the first lighthouses being built on the West
                    Coast and that tending it would be a learning experience for all of us. The coastguard general,
                    Jay H. Longton, told me that he sent a supply ship from San Francisco that would reach us in nearly
                    a month; from the moment of our arrival my family would depend on the supply ships to bring us
                    amenities and also tools and parts for the lighthouse. The general stressed that I take the utmost
                    care of the 3rd-order Fresnel lens that would be coming directly from France.
                    My family and I packed our bags and took a 3 hour long boat ride down to the lighthouse. Upon
                    our arrival I was astonished to find that the lighthouse was located quite literally in the middle
                    of nowhere; not one other building was able to be seen. We landed on the shore and unloaded our
                    belongings. The house itself seemed rather shabby and it was in desperate need renovation in the
                    roofing. The
                    family piled into the compact housing and I ventured out into the mainland to search for materials
                    to repair the damaged roofing.
                    We will continue to live here and get accustomed to the lifehouse life until next year when the
                    lighthouse is planned to be lit.

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Taking Over</h2>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">1855 by Charlotte Layton</p>

                <p> Recently, my husband Charles was shot and killed by an outlaw that goes by the name,
                    Anastacio
                    Garcia. I will now have to step up and assume the duties of my husband as the primary
                    lighthouse keeper of Point Pinos. Sadly, he wasn't even able to be keeper for a full year
                    before
                    passing away. Regardless, I will do my utmost best to maintain the lighthouse and its various
                    assets. My primary duty at the lighthouse will be to maintain the functionality of the Fresnel
                    lens by
                    cleaning it daily and doing regular inspections for any potential issues. Aside from the
                    standard
                    lightouse duties,
                    I still need take care of my children which has become increasingly difficult since I've
                    become
                    windowed and not to mention the time commitments that come with the job. Nevertheless, I am very
                    excited to become the first female lighthouse keeper on the West Coast.

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">My Daily Life as a Keeper</h2>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">1856 by Charlotte Layton</p>

                <p> When I first
                    arrived here a
                    year ago, I thought
                    tending a lighthouse would be exhilarating but I never realized how tedious the job would
                    be. Each task at the lighthouse is described in the lighthouse keeper manual given by the
                    coastguard.
                    Relevant to me, these are most common instructions that I use from the keeper's manual:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Light up the lamps every night at sunset and tend the light, making absolute sure that it
                        continues to burn till the sun rises in the morning</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Be careful with the Fresnel Lens, make sure that it is constantly clean and free of debris. Make
                        absolute sure that the burning wood stays under control and supervision at all times to ensure
                        that there is no risk of a fire outbreak.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Being a lighthouse keeper has many pros and cons. One of the best things about being a keeper is
                    being able to live in the wilderness away from the bustling cities and the chaos of the outside
                    world. At the lighthouse, I enjoy a peaceful waterfront scenery and I enjoy the opportunity of
                    watching the lush blue ocean everyday. On the other hand, the hardest part of being a lighthouse
                    keeper is the unflexible time commitments needed to work the job. According to the manual, I am not
                    allowed to leave the ligthhouse unless first notifying the Superintendent unless the situation is
                    absolutely urgent. The lighthouse is a 24/7 operation that constantly needs a keeper and when the
                    keeper is absent a substitute must takeover.</p>
