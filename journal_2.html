                <p class="blog-post-meta">1871 by Allen Luce</p>

                <p>Today I started my job as keeper of the Point Pinos Lighthouse in the Monterey bay. My first
                    impression of the location is that it is relaxing and peaceful; I prefer this quiet life to the wild
                    big town businessman life. I feel like I might become lonely here but I guess that I'll have to get
                    used to it, maybe I'll end up inviting some friend over to visit and checkout the place. I'm worried
                    that I'll could easily fall behind on my duties as keeeper with nobody around but myself to keep me
                    on track. Speaking of fear, I was scared when I was first handed the lighthouse keeper's manual its
                    thick pages detail countless jobs that I must tend daily. But at the end of the day, I will continue
                    to do my job for the sake of the sailors and ships at sea that rely on my attentiveness.

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">The "Retreat"</h2>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">1875 by Allen Luce</p>

                <p>The area surrounding the lighthouse has seen huge changes over the past few years. Most notably,
                    construction of the second house in this area has begun. I've been watching the construction of this
                    so called "Retreat", a Methodist summer camp, for a few months now. I'm not sure what to make of it,
                    will I enjoy company or will I be annoyed at the forever-gone isolation? Now that I think of it, I'm
                    worried that the construction of this house will lead way to the construction of more houses and
                    possibly a city soon. I initially took this job because not only the high paying salary but mostly
                    because of the isolation and peace that I am able to enjoy out here in the wilderness.

                <h2 class="blog-post-title">Major Changes</h2>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">1889 by Allen Luce</p>

                <p>The last time I wrote in this journal, I was worried about the industrialization of this area.
                    Unfortunately, my suspicions were correct and the area seems to be filling up with new people,
                    buildings, and even vehicles now. I've been here long enough to watch the sad transition of the
                    peaceful lighthouse into a now populated area called the City of Pacific Grove. Throughout the
                    years, this area has been completely transformed. The trees have been cut down and buildings have
                    been planted in their place. From my post, I've experienced a unique opportunity of watching the
                    wilderness be converted into a bustling city. Today there are cars, trains, hotels, and its hard to
                    believe that when I first arrived, Point Pinos was the only house in sight. Not all change is bad
                    though, for me the most useful and positive change was the introduction of the Pacific Grove post
                    office.</p>
