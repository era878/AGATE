        </h2>

        <p class="lead">A job as a lighthouse keeper in the 1800’s and 1900’s was not an easy one. It was a 24 hour, 7
            days a week job with no breaks or days off. The job of the lighthouse keeper was to maintain the light in
            the lighthouse to help ships stay clear from rocky cliffs and dangerous shorelines. Since lighthouses were
            often placed along rocky shores that were difficult to get to, the lighthouse keepers’ job was also isolated
            and lonely. The lighthouse keepers often lived in the most dangerous spots in a body of water. Often, the
            lighthouse keeper’s family and animals lived with him. Lighthouse keepers kept logbooks. These journals told
            their stories of their daily lives at the lighthouse of dusting, cleaning the lens, and filling the oil
            lamps. These kinds of boring jobs had to be done every day. Often lighthouse keepers would bring their
            family and pets. Families remained at the lighthouse for long periods and only left to get supplies at the
            store. Visitors only came by ship to bring food and mail. These visits would be a joyful time. During these
            times, lighthouse workers would sometimes entertain their guests
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
            Today, the job of the lighthouse keeper is not need as much due to electricity and good navigation systems
            on ships. Fewer than 38 lighthouses are needed and the workers check the lights every so often but they are
            not required to be at the lighthouse every day.
