                <p class="blog-post-meta">1893 by Emily Fish</p>

                <p>Today is the anniversary of my husband’s death. My loving husband, Melancthon Fish died in duty in
                    1891. After serving in a number of government posts oversees, Melancthon Fish decided to return to
                    fight for the Union in the American Civil War. I was only 50 years old. We had thirty-three good
                    years together. I always admired his kind face and intelligence as my sister’s husband. After my
                    sister passed away, I married Melancthon at the youthful age of 17. His profession as a medical
                    doctor kept me well taken care of. It wasn’t until his passing that my secure life took a turn. What
                    was I to do? My son-in-law, a naval officer suggested that I take over as the keeper of Point Pinos.
                    He was the Inspector of the 12th District of the Lighthouse Service. Could I run a lighthouse?
                    Usually only woman take over after the death of their spouse that was already a lighthouse keeper,
                    but my son-in-law insisted that I could do the job. On this anniversary, it always marks an end to a
                    fairytale marriage but, then it symbolizes my new beginning as an independent woman.

                <p class="blog-post-meta">1893 by Emily Fish</p>

                <p>Today is moving day. I feel excited and nervous. After applying for the job, I got it! I will be the
                    new lighthouse keeper at Point Pinos. They liked my new ideas and my strength. Today I moved in with
                    my Chinese servant, Que and all of my luxurious furnishings. I figured the place needed to be
                    spruced up a bit and decorated. I brought in my beautiful antique furniture, oil paintings that my
                    husband had brought me from oversees, fine china, silver and leather-bound books.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">1893 by Emily Fish</p>

                <p>Today I started to plant trees and a make a yard around the lighthouse. I brought a lot of rich soil
                    with me and with the help of Que, I began to plant grass to create a beautiful yard.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">1893 by Emily Fish</p>

                <p>The lighthouse grounds are looking better. The grass is coming in nicely. Now, Que and I began
                    planting trees to for shade and cypress hedges around the yard. </p>

                <p>Now that the yard is nice and green and the trees are full and plentiful, I decided to bring animals
                    to Point Pinos. I decided that animals will make the Point Pinos a place for fine entertainment. I
                    decided to bring four French poodles, cows, thoroughbred horses and chickens. I also hired more
                    servants to help keep the grounds neat and tidy.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">1893 by Emily Fish</p>

                <p>The lighthouse is quite the place for entertainment. Through word of mouth, I have a daily flux of
                    famous artists, writers and naval officers who come from ships from in Monterey Bay to see my
                    lighthouse grounds.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">1893 by Emily Fish</p>

                <p>Today I have founded a local committee to help organize supplies for the Monterey-Pacific Grove
                    American Red Cross in honor of my late husband.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">1893 by Emily Fish</p>

                <p>Today I fired my 15th worker. I find that most of the workers are incompetent and do not keep the
                    place as impeccable as I would like.</p>

                <p class="blog-post-meta">1906 by Emily Fish</p>

                <p>At 5:13 a.m. I felt a “violent and continued earthquake” which jarred the lighthouse. Que and I
                    looked around the lighthouse and noticed several cracks that had widened. This considerable damage
                    to the tower will need to be torn down and repaired.</p>
